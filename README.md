## Git Flow for new features
1. Open Visual Studio on The project's folder
2. Log in into your github account
3. In Visual Studio, Open the terminal (CTRL + `, or if it's set differently CTRL + Q and search for "Terminal" should be the first result)
4. Do the Next Commands:
    ```bash
    git pull
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
5. Do your work
6. Do the Next Commands:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "meaningful commit message"
    git push
    ```
7. Create a pull request from the branch you created to the main branch, Here: https://github.com/Shery-Blich/AstroFall/compare
8. Make sure you are updated with the main branch before merging(should be an 'Update branch button, on the merge panel in github')
9. Make sure the code is working without an issue before merging, main should always be the working version of our code!
10. Merge the pull request once it's working, ready and tested!
